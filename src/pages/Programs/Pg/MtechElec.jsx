The objective of the Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) is to give students great opportunities for research and development, as everyday consumers need new devices to support them in daily life. The department prepares the students in such a manner so that they can explore their scientific temperament and come out with novel ideas that can be further put into practice to achieve matchless results. Under the banner of M.Tech. ECE, the students are taught the advanced theoretical and practical postulates of electronics and communication..M.Tech. Graduates in Electronics and Communication can get lucrative job opportunities in some of the popular companies like TCS, Wipro, Siemens, Infosys, etc. Also, students can get incredible job opportunities in the government sector like ISRO, C-DAC, DRDO, and VSSC."}
